\section{Introduction}
The main goal of this project is to make a mobile robot display human-aware behaviours, based on the predicted behaviours of the human the robot is interacting with. 

% Here insert Theorectical Introduction


The Human Robot Interaction problem was approached with certain assumptions/approximations as a basis for our work. These are the assumptions that our project tries to prove: 

\begin{itemize}
\item People tend to interact with other people with well defined and clear sequences of movements and gestures;
\item The sequences of gestures tend to be similar for a given situation even across different people;
\item A Machine Learning Classifier will be able to capture information that would be too hard to explicitly program. $\rightarrow$ This system should have improved results over explicitly programmed solutions;
\end{itemize}

With these items in mind we developed a setup to test our approach. The robot detects gestures and movements of the user and based on the sequence tries to predict what next action should be taken.
