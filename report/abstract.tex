Within the framework of this project, in order to be able to have an interaction between the human user and the robot it was used a Kinect camera, the Scout base robot and the Katana arm.\\
The Kinect was used for the system to learn informations about the outer world, in this case to learn about positions and movements of the user, with help of a skeleton-tracker software.\\
For controlling the Scout a simple controller was created that allows the robot to move forward and backwards.\\
The Katana represents one big part of the robot interaction, given that the robotic arm has a lot of movement possibilities being therefore possible to replicate human-like movements/behaviours.\\
Between the input information coming from the Kinect and the output provided by the Scout and Katana a machine learning algorithm was developed to introduce the prevision part of the project to the whole system.
