\section{Conclusion}
After the experimental results there are clearly some pros \& cons about the implemented solution, such as:\\

Pros:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast (small processing needed)
\item Scalable - with some improvements it should be able to identify gestures not explicitly programmed
\item Allows the incorporation of both explicit and implicit knowledge (which is impossible with an hand programmed solution)
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
\item There must exist a training set
\item Hard to evaluate if the robot action is predicted or just a reaction to an user's action
\item Hard to predict performance before complete implementation
\item The features used in this project may not be the best ones
\end{itemize}

As in all engineering projects, there is always room for improvements. In this case, the suggested improvements are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Train Classifier with finer features (for instance, calculate angles between all joints given by the skeleton tracker, or even use all the raw data from the tracker)
\item Train Classifier with features with a constant time interval between samples
\item Incorporate Laser Range Finder, Sonar and Kinect Audio Data
\item Use Kinect to track \textit{Adele}
\item Program the 2-Dimensions controller for Scout.
\end{itemize}
