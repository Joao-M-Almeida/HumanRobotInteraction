\section{Project Structure}

There are three main components of the architecture of the implemented system. The \textit{Action Node}, the \textit{Decision Node} and the \textit{Sensor/Kinect Node}. These three nodes have very distinct roles and are structured in a way that could be expanded for more complex robots. This structure is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:adele_structure}.
